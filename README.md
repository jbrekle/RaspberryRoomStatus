# Raspberry Room Status

A room activity tracker and manages reservations.

## Concept

A Raspberry Pi can be placed in a room (w/o windows) to react on changing light (bulb) conditions. When the light is on, we define that someone is inside the room accordingly.

This information can then be used for a queuing reservation manager.

With [KLO](https://github.com/DominikHerold/KLO "KLO") exists a TrayIcon to gather this light information as well.
